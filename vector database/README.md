This project implements a document-based Question-Answering (QA) system that allows users to get data from stock API and ask questions about the content. The system processes the document, extracts relevant text, and enables users to query the information using an AI model. It also stores past queries in an SQLite database for persistent history.
The backend uses LangChain for document processing, Hugging Face transformers for embeddings and text generation, FAISS for vector search, and Streamlit for the frontend UI.
